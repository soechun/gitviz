# 1. Introduction 
- The objective of the assignment is to visualize the statistic and user behaviors of contributors working on the linux github repository. Github developer api is used to retrieve the data from `https://github.com/torvalds/linux`. 
- Three main area of user behavoir is analyzed and visualized.
    1. Number of commits per week within a year
    2. What time and date are developers most active on github
    3. Languages used in the repositories of the owner of linux github
## Contributions
- Contributors of this project are:
    1. Yumeng Yin()
    2. Shwe Soe Chun (E0210469)
- For every graph, there is a main visualizer and helper.  Yumeng acts as the main visualizer for first and third charts and the second chart is done by Soe Chun. 
- Task and responsibility allocation
    - Type of visualization to use for all objectives are brainstormed together
    - Project Setup, initial data query from api and processing, adding mouse events to the graphs are done by Shwe Soe Chun
    - Yumeng act as the main visualizer and worked on the basics of the graphs used. Further data processing to fit data into d3 format and finalizing the graphs are also done by Yumeng
